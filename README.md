# cc6
- GPU raycaster based on the six-direction box-spline (cc6)
- Implementation of the algorithm proposed in the article
  - ``Volume Reconstruction with the Six-Direction Cubic Box-Spline'' (2022, in revision) by Hyunjun Kim & Minho Kim (Dept. of Computer Science and Enginnering, University of Seoul)
- Implemented in Python3 with OpenGL binding.
- How to run: >> python3 raycaster_cc6.py <volume_data_name>
  - volume_data_name: one of {"ML40", "ML50", "ML80"}.
